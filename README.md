🚀 [Launch Tutorial](https://mdlama.github.io/Programming_Basics/)

## Course Description

R is easiest to use when you know how the R language works. This
tutorial will teach you the implicit background knowledge that informs
every piece of R code.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn about:

- **functions** and their **arguments**
- **objects**
- R’s basic **data types**
- R’s basic data structures including **vectors** and **lists**
- R’s **package system**

### Built with

[Quarto Live](https://r-wasm.github.io/quarto-live/) - WebAssembly
powered code blocks and exercises for Quarto HTML documents. Quarto is
the “next generation” of [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).
Quarto Live uses [WebR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/), which
facilitates running R code directly in the browser with no need for a
server.
